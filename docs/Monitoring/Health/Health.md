## Monitor the System Health

Below is just a snapshot in time of the monitoring jumpscripts.

Also check the **JumpScript** page in the **Grid Portal** where you can filter on **monitor.health** to see a list of the JumpScripts actually available on your environment:

In order to check the actual system health go to the **Status Overview** page in the **Grid Portal**, also reachable by clicking the green, orange or red colored bullet in the top navigation bar:

For more information about the **Status Overview** page go to the dedicated section [here](../../GridPortal/StatusOverview/StatusOverview.md).

In what follows you get overview of all JumpScripts, organized in the same way (sections) as on the **Node Status** page.

Depending on the type of node, following sections are available:
