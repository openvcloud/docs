## Groups

In order for users to have access to the various OpenvCloud portals they need to be member of specific groups.

The **Groups** page lists all groups:

![](Groups.png)

There are three main groups:

- The **user** group for restricting which users have access to the [End User Portal](#end-user)
- The **admin** group for restricting which users have access to the [Operator Portals](#operator)
- The **ovs_storage** group for restricing which user have access to the [Storage Portal](#storage)

More details and all other groups are discussed below.

Clicking the **Name** of a group in the **Groups** table brings you to the **Group Details** page of that group:

![](GroupDetails.png)

Under **Users** all users that are member of the group are listed.

By clicking the **ID** of a group you navigate to the **User Details** page of that user.

The **Action** drop down menu allows you to **edit** group properties or **delete** the group.

> Note that you can also select **Add Group** from the **Action** menu on the **Group** page, allowing you to add/create your own groups. Currently you can't do much however with this...

### End User Portal

Within the **End User Portal** specific user rights are further defined by the end user authorization model, discussed [here](../../EndUserPortal/Authorization/AuthorizationModel.md)

The **finance** group is a legacy "sub" group of the **user** group. Membership of the **finance** group was required to access the **Consumption** page in the **End User Portal**; this page got however depreciated.

<a id="operator"></a>
### Operator Portals

The **Operator Portals** include the **At Your Service Portal**, **Cloud Broker Portal**, **Statistics Portal**, **Grid Portal** and the **System Portal**.

Within the **Operator Portals** specific user rights are further defined by membership of one of the following "sub" groups:

- [level1](#level1)
- [level2](#level2)
- [level3](#level3)

> Note that membership of the **level1**, **level2** and **level3** groups also requires explicit membership of the **admin** group

<a id="level2"></a>
Following **Stack Details** page actions require **level2** group membership:

- **Enable**
- **Put in Maintenance**
- **Decommission**


<a id="level3"></a>
Currently there is no functionality that requires **level 3** membership. So **level 3** membership will not yield any additional privileges to a user with **admin** group membership.

### Storage Portal

In order to have access to the **Storage Portal**, **ovs_admin** membership is required.
