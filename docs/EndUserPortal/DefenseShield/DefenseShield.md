## Defense Shield

Each virtual datacenter (cloud space) gets its own virtual private network which is protected by the **Defense Shield**.

In the **End User Portal** we try to keep it as simple as possible by only exposing the most important and relevant features to the end user.

Consequently most of the **Defense Shield** configuration options are hidden, as you can see on the **Defense Shield** page:

By clicking the **Advanced Shield configuration** button you get access to all configuration options of the virtual private network:
