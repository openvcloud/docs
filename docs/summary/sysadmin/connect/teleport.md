# Teleport

Our teleport is running on all our controllers and is installed during the instalation of the controller. It runs as a systemd service and authenticates via github. See [system-config](../../installation/system-config.md) for details about authentication.

Teleports runs under the root domain of the envrionment on port 3080. For example:

`https://myg8.mydomain.com:/3080`

After going to the teleport portal click the **Login with Gtihub** button.
