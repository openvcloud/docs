# Grid Portal

A grid is a logical grouping of nodes and the definition of the interactions between them.

The grid portal is a way to help manage such a setup, without having to hunt down each piece of information on a different machine/node. It's a visualization of all the grid components. This gives a centralized overview of everything that happens within the grid

## To Install the gridportal

```
ays install -n gridportal --data 'portal.instance:main'
# Where the portal.instance is the desired portal's instance for the gridportal to run on top of.
```

## Components:

- [Installed Nodes](Nodes.md)
- [Jobs](Jobs.md)
- [Errors](Errors.md)
- [Grid health](CheckStatus.md)
